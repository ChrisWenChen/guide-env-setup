# A Guide to Setting Up a Research Environment for Many-Body Computations

This is a **step-by-step environment setup guide** specially prepared for students who are about to systematically learn numerical computations for quantum many-body systems (though it may also be useful for other fields!). Whether you are using macOS, Windows, Linux, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), this guide will help you build a complete and efficient research environment from scratch.

We not only cover the core computational toolchain – **Python, Julia, Fortran/C/C++, MPI, BLAS/LAPACK (including OpenBLAS/MKL), PETSc/SLEPc** – but also carefully include essential daily research tools: cloud storage synchronization, reference management (Zotero), version control (Git), terminal optimization, and more, to make your research work more productive.

All example codes have been tested and are hosted in the GitHub repository [guide-env-setup/codes](https://github.com/ChrisWenChen/guide-env-setup/tree/main/codes), where you can download and verify them at any time.
